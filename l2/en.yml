  We tried to lookup the IP address of a domain that has an A record, and failed.

  %{command_and_output}

  We expected the output to look like `ruby-lang.org => 221.186.184.75`, but we couldn't confirm that.

  We tried to lookup the IP address of a domain that starts with a CNAME record, and failed.

  %{command_and_output}

  We expected the output to look like `gmail.com => mail.google.com => google.com => 172.217.163.46`, but we couldn't confirm that.
missing_record_fail: |-
  We tried to lookup the IP address of a domain that wasn't in the `zone` file, and expected a proper error message, but didn't see any.

  %{command_and_output}

  We expected the output to be an error message like `Error: record not found for foo.com`.
unlinked_record_fail: |-
  It looks like the student may have forgotten to handle _unlinked_ records.

  %{command_and_output}

  We expected the output to be an error message like `Error: record not found for example.com`.
command_and_output: |-
  This is the command we ran:

  ```bash
  %{command}
  ```

  This is the ouput that we got:

  ```
  %{output}
  ```
zone_file: |-
  This is the contents of the `zone` file that we used for all tests:

  ```
  # This file is called `zone`. This is what should be read in `lookup.rb`.
  # RECORD TYPE, SOURCE, DESTINATION
  A, ruby-lang.org, 221.186.184.75
  A, google.com, 172.217.163.46

  CNAME, www.ruby-lang.org, ruby-lang.org
  CNAME, mail.google.com, google.com
  CNAME, gmail.com, mail.google.com

  # An extra CNAME that goes nowhere.
  CNAME, nowhere.example.com, example.com
  ```
