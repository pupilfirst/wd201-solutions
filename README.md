# Solutions & tests for WD201 assignments

## WARNING: DO NOT LOOK AT SOLUTIONS...

...unless you've already received maximum grades in that assignment, or have been instructed to take a look by a coach or TA.

### Why shouldn't you look at solutions?

If you look at the solution too early, you're bypassing the learning process which involves a degree of struggle. Also,
if you're unwilling to face the difficulty of the basic tasks that these assignments present, then the web development
industry is probably not the right choice for you. Your day-to-day job as a professional programmer will be a lot tougher.
