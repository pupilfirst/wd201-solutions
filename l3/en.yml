execution_error: |-
  We tried to run the command `ruby todo_list.rb`, but we ran into an execution error. This is what we got an as error message:

  ```
  %{output}
  ```

  We expected the output to contain a todo list, but we couldn't confirm that.
output_mismatch: |-
  We tried to run the command `ruby todo_list.rb`, but the output we got wasn't in a shape that we expected.

  This is the output we saw:

  ```
  %{output}
  ```

  This is the _diff_ between what we got, and what we expected to see. This should help you meet this test's expectations:

  ```diff
  %{diff}
  ```
success: |-
  Tests passed. This was the output that we received:

  ```
  %{output}
  ```
